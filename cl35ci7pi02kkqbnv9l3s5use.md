Would you ever travel to an unexpected location without your trusted map app? The same may be said about every product firm. An experienced product manager understands that developing the perfect product requires time, as well as careful planning and financial calculations. Nobody has ever created the "ideal" product in a matter of days, weeks, or even months. This is why a SaaS product roadmap is critical for a company's strategic development and success. Before we get into the actual process of creating a product roadmap, let us first define what it is and why it is THE most critical aspect of a SaaS firm.

## What is Enterprise Readiness?

Enterprise readiness is a blueprint for developing or improving a SaaS solution with common characteristics that will improve enterprise ways to reach customers. Enterprise readiness was designed for those who create SaaS solutions, such as founders, product managers, and engineering team leads.

### What is a SaaS Roadmap?

A SaaS product roadmap depicts the actions that a firm must take to continuously create and enhance its services. It strikes a balance between the technical components of product creation and strategic know-how. The visual summary is used to illustrate to all stakeholders the product strategy for software-as-a-service solutions and to maintain stakeholder engagement.

### Why SaaS Roadmap?

These roadmaps are especially important for the strategic planning of goods that are constantly updated. It serves as the foundation for subsequent implementation strategies. Of course, separate product roadmaps exist for various stakeholders such as investors, sales teams, existing customers, future consumers, and so on. The roadmap for the development team, for example, contains the product's features, themes, design, and other technicalities, whereas the roadmap for the sales team often concentrates on the product's overview and consumer advantages. The value that the roadmap provides to consumers and how expenses are handled are the two most important aspects of the roadmap.

BoxyHQ's low-code technology platform enables SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) companies to easily add functionality to their products and make them more accessible to business clients. Developers are mostly drawn to security, authorization, user access, data privacy, compliance, and other aspects that are both important and time-demanding.

Here are 6 ways to build enterprise readiness into your SaaS product roadmaps:

1. Integration

 It's the digital age, and most businesses employ a variety of programs. As a result, your SaaS product structure should be simple to connect with the current ones. As a result of this, users will be able to interact with your product more easily.

2. Customization

 Despite the fact that SaaS solutions have the same framework, clients' demands vary. Customers want the freedom to modify them based on their needs. In today's environment, operations are moving at a faster pace. To deal with it, create SaaS apps that provide automated distribution and onboarding services.

3. Authentication systems

 Companies have begun to rely entirely on SaaS products for the majority of business procedures. And it necessitates a great deal of data manipulation. SaaS applications must use authentication solutions such as Single Sign-On and Multi-Factor authentication.

4. Multitenant architecture

 The capacity to manage several clients at the same time is referred to as multitenancy. The users are all using the same instance of the app. It's quick, efficient, and simple to maintain.

5. Auditing and activity monitoring

 Having audit logs will allow your users to trackback to actions and determine where things went wrong. This feature is particularly successful in SaaS applications since it adds to operational security and activity tracking.

## Steps to implement product roadmap for Saas

- Define your short and long-term objectives, and then design the best approach for achieving them.

- Collect feedback from all stakeholders. Your stakeholders for an internal roadmap are the members of your team. In the case of an external roadmap, those are your consumers and future clients.

- Filter and prioritize the information obtained in accordance with your company's vision and commercial objectives.

- Begin making plans! You must allocate resources and establish a workflow. That entails forming a team, appointing a leader, establishing a timeline and deadlines, and allocating funds.

- Create a product roadmap using the components specified in the preceding phases.

- To keep everyone informed, keep your SaaS product roadmap updated on a regular basis. A roadmap can be created using a variety of tools and formats.
