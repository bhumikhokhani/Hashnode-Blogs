# Introduction
What comes to your mind when you hear the word graphic design? Posters? Paintings? Art? No one thing can fully define what graphic design is. In this article we will discuss the basics of graphic designing and later learn in-depth what is the role of a graphic designer. So, let's dive into the topic now. 

## What is Graphic Design?
Graphic designing is a vast field, where basically we create visual content to communicate using typography and pictures, creating interactive designs. It's more of a commercial art, therefore it's focus is on a large audience.

## What is a good design?
A design that delivers the true meaning and thoughts of a product, maintaining all it's attractiveness and quality is a good design.<br>
Let me explain by an example, the design by the Spotify ad, because it has vibrant colors and by the way it is put up, it seems like a mature design.

## What is a bad design?
Sometimes, a design delivering graphics, layouts, taglines or images, may fail in anyone of them resulting in misinterpretation of the entire design, that's a bad design.<br>
A good explanation of this is, Nivea's ad of 2017. It had a caption, "White is purity", which was a racist comment, this had led to a lot of criticism by the people and the media.
