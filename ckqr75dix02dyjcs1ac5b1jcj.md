# Introduction
In this fast paced world, sometimes the students are left clueless about what to do next. How to get ahead to develop skills and move towards professionalism.  Especially when situations like this pandemic occur.

### Is it the responsibility of the institute?
Not really, because the work of the institutes is mainly to train you in the subjects you have chosen and make sure you master the syllabus. 

### So, how do we move ahead?
Look, it's normal to be lost and clueless. But along with it, it's important to know that you have to dig into your own way and sometimes even learn it the hard-way.

### What can you do?

1. ** Stop procrastinating** <br>
Normal tendency of students is to wait until the final year of their college to start working towards their profession. Stop there, you need to change it. From the time you start your college life, apart from your academic life, you need to even start working towards the professional tag you want to achieve. So, start searching for opportunities, apply, get some real-world experience.

2. **Sketching** <br>
Have an idea, a rough sketch of what you want to do in life. Where do you want to stand. In what kind of environment you want to work. Where do you want to work. Having a rough plan is always good. If you still don't have a plan, it's okay. It happens with most of them and it's normal.

3. **Discovering yourself** <br>
To start searching for opportunities, you need to know what's the domain you want to work in. It can be as a web developer, graphic designer, app developer, anything. But you need to learn your interests. To know your interests, start testing yourself. Experiment working on different domains you think that interests you. Start working over small projects while you are experimenting. Not only will you have small projects in hand but also have a certain exposure and clearer idea about the domain. 

4. **Resources** <br>
Now, once you know what interests you, from where do you start learning from? Contact your seniors, your friends who you think have experience working in that particular field. It's okay to ask. There is nothing bad but a lot of good. You learn if the profession is something as you had thought it be. You will start getting clearer about a lot of things and will be able to start filtering by comparing what you want and the reality of how it is. 
Now, to start learning again you can contact your friends, seniors. Know their journey and know from where to begin with the learning process. And not repeat the mistakes they have done. Alternatively, you can surf through the web. There's a lot of content available online, about almost all the domains. There are people sharing their experiences, stories, guides and what not. You can find soo many courses, tutorials or blogs and learn anything you wish to and master it.

5. **Expand your skill-set** <br>
Student life is very crucial. Start working on yourself, everyday. Learn about new technologies. Know the updates and the trends. Start practicing and updating your portfolio with every new thing you do.  

6. **Mapping** <br>
With every new thing you learn about, you start discovering more. You start matching your learnings to your thoughts of what you enjoy working with. Start mapping your journey as to where you want all your skills, experiences and achievements to take you. Know where you're heading to and start fixing your short-term and long-term goals.

7. **Hooked to LinkedIn** <br>
It's so very important to learn about the real-world scenarios by your own too. Start connecting to people with similar interests or goals like yours. Connect with those who have achieved that position already. Talk to them and learn how is it to work in that position or in a particular company. With every step moving forward, get your picture clearer.

8. **Experiences** <br>
It's time to get your knowledge and skill-set to action. Apply for different internships, build projects, get the experience of completing the tasks meeting the standard and constraints and also simultaneously manage time by meeting deadlines. This will get you experience of working on projects in a company and also make you industry-ready.  Internshala is one such platform to apply to all kinds of internships.

9. **Get your dream job** <br>
