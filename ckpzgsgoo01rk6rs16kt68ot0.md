<h1> Introduction </h1>

Before diving into the languages directly, let's first get to know what exactly is web development and next get into reading the most frequently asked questions. 

<h1>Diving In</h1>
<h3>What is Web Development?</h3>

Look, you don't necessarily know everything at the start. So don't get into jumping into all coding languages in the beginning. Take one particular language, make a practice to learn a concept everyday. Mark your progress, and step up to the next language.

There are 3 types of web developers. Let me take you to each one of them and describe what each one has to do.

**2) Back-end Developer: **<br>
