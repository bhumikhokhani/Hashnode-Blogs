## Introduction

Search is one of the few technologies that has been a huge part of our daily life. It's everywhere — e-commerce sites, blogs, knowledge bases, etc— not because a search box and icons are visually appealing, but because they perform a major role.

What should you do if you're a business seeking a solid Search solution or are fed up with your current one?

Although it may look difficult, implementing a sophisticated search tool for your e-commerce site is neither difficult nor time-consuming. and fortunately, you don't even have to pay those high license fees. Here is one solid solution, Typesense Cloud, which is not only easy to install, but also quick to integrate and start working with. Let's know more about Typesense cloud in this article.

## What is Typesense Cloud?

Typesense is a simple yet effective search engine that is easy to use. Those searching for efficiency and simplicity should definitely give this one a shot.

One of the most appealing aspects of Typesense is that you can test it immediately on their website. In scenarios when you put everything up and test the API, this can save you time and hassle.

Finally, if the thought of setting up additional servers is too much for you, Typesense offers a cloud service, Typesense Cloud that allows you to set up servers with a single click. Billing is done by the hour, with reads and writes being unmetered. To be honest, I believe this is the preferable alternative for the majority of firms, providing they have worked out the pricing in advance and ensured it is a net gain.

Overall, Typesense makes a lot of sense if you require something compact, sleek, precise, and reliable.

## Why Typesense Cloud?

Typesense Cloud is Typesense's hosted Search-as-a-Service (SaaS) version, which is lightning fast and distributed internationally. It functions similarly to a CDN, but only for search. Typesense Cloud is where data is stored, thus you must host/save your Website data somewhere for Typesense to connect with it. Deploy nodes throughout the world to give the users a lightning-fast search experience.

Typesense clusters can be up and running in a matter of minutes. It is also available on a local level for development.

When it comes to a search engine of choice, TypesenseCloud has a lot going for it:

1. Its underlying technology is completely open-source and friendly.

2. If you want HA (High Availability), it is simple to set up.

3. Tolerant of typos and other forms of interference in search queries.

4. A sophisticated filtering technique for individuals who want fine-grained control over search results.

5. Simple REST API, albeit their documentation will make you work twice as hard to locate it!

6. Some of the main languages have clients (SDKs) available (JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and PHP).

### Features of Typesense Cloud

**1. Pricing on an hourly basis**

As needed, spin the clusters up and down. To find the best configuration, do performance runs. Pay only for what you use, by the hour.

**2. NO PER-SEARCH/PER-RECORD CHARGES**

The cluster assigned to you is reserved for your business alone, and there are no record/operation costs or overages. You are free to add records and searches as much as your cluster can manage.

**3. Search Delivery Network**

Similar to a CDN, but for search. Deploy nodes throughout the world that are closest to your users to give them an ultra-fast search experience.

**4. Set up a Search Delivery Network in minutes**

It's similar to a CDN, but it's for Search. Your search indices are spread over different geographic areas, and search traffic is sent to the node that is closest to the origin of the request.

Your users will appreciate a lightning-fast search experience. Also, you get to choose from over 20 global regions.

**5. Allow the experts to host your search.**

We know the INs, OUTs, and Everything-In-Betweens of Typesense Open Source since we wrote it. Allow us to manage and maintain a search cluster on your behalf.

- Designed with the core concepts of security and dependability in mind.

- Every cluster you create is isolated and only for your use.

- TLSv1.3 is used to encrypt data in transit.

- For data at rest, full disc encryption is used.

**6. Configure to meet your specific requirements.**

- To accommodate datasets of any size, up to 768 GB RAM is available.

- Up to 480 virtual CPUs are available to meet the most demanding traffic requirements.

- Optional capacity auto-scaling when you transmit additional data/new traffic data

- Fast IOPS for big documents using NVMe SSDs

- Multi-node At the flick of a switch, you may have high availability.

### Pricing

The minimum configuration recommended is RAM of 0.5 GB.

I personally recommend:

- Starting with the least vCPU option available for this RAM and gradually building up from there.

- A minimum of 4 vCPUs for requests above 20 per second.

- If your traffic is frequent, a Burst vCPU option might help you save money.

- Enabling High Availability for Production deployment.

- Use Search Delivery Network if your users are spread throughout different cities.

- Use the High-Performance Disk option if your records are larger than 1KB.
