A significant new technique in software development is the integration of development and operations. Whether you're new to DevOps techniques or looking to improve your current ones, determining which technology is right for your team can be difficult.

This article provides a category-by-category breakdown of some of the most popular DevOps tools available in the market. We will start with the specifics of what DevOps is, why we need it, the criteria to find the right tool and the top ten DevOps tools to use in 2022.

# What is DevOps?

DevOps tools make DevOps practices a reality by covering the full software development cycle, including code reviews, version control, deployment, and monitoring.

It is an automation tool for the software development process. It primarily focuses on product management, software development, and operations professionals' communication and cooperation. DevOps tools also enable teams to automate most software development activities such as build, conflict management, dependency management, deployment, and so on, reducing manual work.
