## Introduction

In the twenty-first century, eCommerce has achieved its pinnacle, especially after the pandemic. The sector is continuously exploding and is expected to reach $7 trillion by the end of 2024. Moreover, the tech world is celebrating the feat with a new headless e-commerce architecture. You might have heard the phrase headless before. Today, the word is synonymous with a tailored customer experience across countless buying channels.

In the blog, we’ll dig deeper into the headless eCommerce space, decode some of the top headless commerce systems trending in 2022, and which one to pick as per your needs. Let’s start!

## What is Headless eCommerce?

Traditionally, the eCommerce space has employed a full-stack approach to drive operations. The plan worked well among the first-generation internet users, it made sense back then! However, the idea comes with low scalability and user control. Now that the world is moving more toward personalization, eCommerce has come up with a more dynamic approach offering omnichannel experiences and a lot of space for testing by going headless.

In Headless platforms, the frontend of an eCommerce platform is isolated from the backend, which contains the complete business logic in an architectural style.

Consider the PlayStation. When you purchase a PlayStation, you buy a console or device that lets you play games. You may, however, connect it to any monitor or television you wish. You'll be able to see and play the games as long as you have the necessary cable for both your display and PlayStation.

In this case, the PlayStation console is a headless server. Its significant concentration is on it. It contains all of the logic required to carry out particular functions. It distinguishes how these features and data are displayed to the user.

To put it another way, headless eCommerce refers to eCommerce that works well without a head (the frontend interface). This strategy allows the brand the flexibility to create anything they want while customizing the whole user journey. Even Google’s latest study supports the fact that personalization drove customers to spend 40% more time on eCom sites. Now is the time to go headless!

## How Does Being Headless Work in eCommerce?

The epidemic is to blame for the unexpected increase in eCommerce sales. Second, leading eCommerce technologies such as Amazon make innovative technology available to their customers. Nacelle, Commercetools, Medusa Commerce Layer, Chord, and Bold are some headless platforms gaining traction in the commerce landscape.

This headless strategy benefits a wide range of companies. It lets companies with markets in various countries deliver culturally and linguistically suitable content while accommodating a range of currencies. Marketers for luxury and experiential businesses should focus on generating appealing visual content that will function across several platforms and devices rather than worrying about specific backend interfaces. Let’s see what else headless platforms offer:

- Reduce the expense of developing an eCommerce system from scratch.
