With little notice and limited resources, the worldwide epidemic demanded the development of new business models, new business processes, and new ways of connecting with clients.

So, how can you stay competitive in 2022? The capacity to change your company models and operations fast.

As per the surveys conducted, [LCNC (Low-Code or No-Code)](https://blog.tooljet.com/low-code-no-code-the-way-ahead/) is now generating new customer-facing solutions for 73% of C-level executives. It is expected to create new business rules and process controls, according to 50% of responses.

Here’s a look at what low-code platforms, enable you to run your businesses by increasing productivity, reducing time and effort, and lowering development costs. And how in 2022, businesses will highly use low-code trends to shorten the development life cycle of software and apps. We will also discuss one of the most effective and efficient [open-source tools](https://blog.tooljet.com/how-to-build-and-maintain-welcoming-open-source-communities/) that will help you through the same. So, let’s get started.

# **What is Low-Code?**

[Low-code/no-code](https://blog.tooljet.com/understanding-the-low-code-vs-no-code-debate-what-are-the-differences/) development remains an important technique for enterprises that need to keep up with the rising speed of the digital world and the ever-changing demands of the marketplace in this new environment, and it should be utilized in combination with traditional development.

These platforms assist technical and non-technical professionals in the company in developing and designing applications without the need for extensive coding. Non-developers can contribute to application development through the graphical user interface, which substitutes hand-coded project implementation. When low code no-code platforms are employed, the application's functionality is greatly increased without a significant increase in coding complexity.

# **Why Low-Code?**

[Low-code](https://aviyel.com/post/3246) development refers to the use of easy drag-and-drop activities, AI and machine learning, API and plugin integrations, visual modeling, and other techniques to create software or apps.

These development solutions are really an important element of the success of many successful firms. Low-code solutions have been the appropriate tool at the right moment for revolutionizing development, enabling business-critical changes to happen faster, and cutting development costs.

# **Features**

* While productivity is increased, there can be a possible threat to security as the control over the system moves from professional programmers to non-technical agencies.
    
* The need for business applications in the places where collaborative work along with communication is a must, low-code commits to collaborative platforms.
    
* Automation saves your company time and money by avoiding and overcoming time-consuming processes.
    

# **8 Low code trends**

No-code can be 100 times faster than hand-coding, according to Forbes, and can be used by almost anybody. This gives up a lot of exciting options while potentially blurring the departmental lines. Finding which of these tools can be utilized where, for what purpose, and by whom is the key to success with modern technology.

## 1\. Workflow automation powered by low-code

For numerous years, new technologies have been used to automate corporate activities. Low-code solutions are already being used by businesses to integrate new technology. Companies are trying to make automation a reality due to a shortage of trained developers and financial resources. Regardless, they are compelled to automate. They're also encouraged by the rising technological capabilities of workflow automation technologies, as well as the advantages their competitors claim to have gained from employing them. They use low-code solutions to make technology more accessible as they try to upgrade their systems.

Therefore, it's clear that the definite value of low-code will always keep growing with its importance in providing automation solutions.

## 2\. Cybersecurity has never been more important

The global cost of data breaches is expected to reach $4.8 million by 2024. Add to that the ongoing epidemic and the digital transition it has accelerated, and hackers will have an increasing number of possibilities to conduct a disruptive attack. By looking for weak spots in an organization's IT armor, robust security procedures may prevent fraud, information leaks, malware, ransomware, phishing, and other assaults.

Within a day, 45 percent of firms with complete security integration can repair significant vulnerabilities. Integrating security technologies such as hashing protocols, machine learning algorithms for fraud detection, and blockchain-based solutions can help your company avoid cyber attacks by mitigating critical security risks.

## 3\. Low-code development based on APIs

With over 24,000 public APIs available, another major trend in current development is emerging with the usage of APIs, which is increasing in lockstep with the low-code tech sector. This statistic excludes the hundreds of thousands of private APIs used by businesses to link their IT systems.

APIs are, simply expressed, one of the most important technologies in today's app development. As a result, low-code platforms rely on APIs to enable businesses to easily design and integrate feature-rich apps into their current systems. In the future, low-code solutions are likely to rely on even more API management and orchestration capabilities.

## 4\. 5G, a revolutionizing network technology

5G is one of the most recent technologies set to transform the global communications industry. The market for 5G technology is estimated to be $6.47 billion by the end of 2023, rising to $667.90 billion by 2026.

Because 4G runs at a reduced speed and uses significant energy, which shortens battery life, 5G may be defined as a technological enabler for IoT and future emerging tech items. In comparison, 5G is expected to provide lower latency, more capacity, and improved data security. Developers will be able to construct more powerful apps, and consumers will be able to have better experiences sooner.

## 5\. A highly configurable user interface

Over the last decade, the expectations for an app's or solution's user experience have shifted dramatically. Low-code platforms already contain templates, layouts, and styles to solve this. These technologies enable businesses to swiftly create user-friendly products. Low-code will enable even more customization choices in the future. Businesses will be able to design highly distinctive user experiences based on ready-made templates and components with these possibilities.

## 6\. Legacy modernization using low-code

Many businesses today face the challenge of updating outdated systems and integrating legacy solutions with new technologies. Low-code platforms can no longer rely solely on tools for developing new apps. Without requiring businesses to hire developers who are familiar with outdated programming languages such as RPG and COBOL, they will need the technical know-how to interact with and upgrade legacy systems. Businesses will increasingly rely on low-code platforms in this sector.

## 7\. Low Code Will Expand the eCommerce Market

In this period of the digital revolution, global recognition of no-code and low-code has apparently been acknowledged to boost the e-commerce market portfolio by 22%. This has been a decade of rapidly evolving e-commerce, which was formerly dominated by Amazon and Flipkart which had the increased practicality owing to cloud-based speedy and effective management that does not require coding. Because cloud-based technologies are constantly accessible, application development is extremely dependable.

For a speedy and dependable development at a cheap cost, e-commerce sites are now employing no-code/low code. While the e-commerce marketplaces consume no-code/low-code quicker than others, it’s expected that by 2030, developers are expected to account for 80% of all development work on it. The promise of dependability and speedy use of low code and no code technologies has resulted in an increase in the number of active e-commerce platforms.

## 8\. The use of many platforms

Another big stumbling block for corporate developers is developing and supporting numerous versions of an application for desktop and mobile platforms. Low-code solutions will become increasingly competent in the future allowing firms to simply deploy and manage their solutions across several platforms.
