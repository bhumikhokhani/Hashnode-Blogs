## ***Heyyy guyss!***

Today is a special day. I finally created my blog, about which I have been thinking from a very long time, to share my work, projects and a part of my life.

Being this crazy about web-dev always, I joined the Sudan-Tech's Workshop on web development. Learnt soo many new things which I was always confused about. After all the amazing sessions we had and the tasks we completed, it was time to make our final project. 

> 
A mixture of all the things we learnt. 

### Ideation

So, the question was what project should I make? Some application or a website. 
How about a fusion? 
Finally I decided to make a **web-app**; A simple yet an interesting game that we all have played in our childhood.
 

> 
A Jigsaw Puzzle!

 I used to love solving puzzles. I had soo many boxes of such puzzle games at my home.

### Learning
Coming back to the topic, I had no idea. How do I start? What should I do?
Completely clueless. Surfed through the web, watched videos. Finally taking references and understanding the javascripts built this simple **Jigsaw Puzzle Game**.


### Progress
The working is simple, there is a reference image at the top which changes every time the site is refreshed. There are different options from which the player can choose his difficulty level by selecting how many pieces will he solve. 
According to the code, when the reference image and the solved puzzle matches the game is over. I added slight more simple animations for the motions and coded other logics for the working.

### More Progress
After this one game, I started searching for other games that I can build using **JS**. Cause now I discovered how powerful and also weird JS was, I made a game called **"Find The Match"**, where basically we match the similar cards before the timer is up.

*Switch to 0.5x for better experience...*

### This was one crazy discovery!

I never knew **JS** was so powerful, until I heard about it in the sessions and actually surfed through the web about it while making the project. 
For sure I'm going to experiment more with JS and build many more **web-apps **in future. 


> 
Trust me, using something built by you brings a different kind of joy.

*Thank you @[Smile Gupta](@smilegupta) for taking up all those sessions and acknowledging us about so many new things. Looking forward to attend many more workshops by you.*

### Conclusion
Finally, I would like to conclude, try **experimenting** with your codes, **surfing** about things you are crazy about. **Never stop learning.** 

> 
*Because there is soo much more, you know nothing about
and tech is much more than you can even imagine. It's never-ending!*
