# Introduction

The transition to digital, the increase of mobile shopping, and the ongoing movement in consumer preference from brand loyalty to service loyalty make retail the only sector that comes to mind at the moment that closely matches it.

Every year, thousands of new e-commerce companies are established. When it comes to selecting a [platform](https://aviyel.com/post/3001/top-headless-e-commerce-platforms-in-2022), new online shops have no shortage of choices. Should you pick a website plugin like WooCommerce or [Shopify](https://www.shopify.in/) over a hosted platform like [Medusa](https://aviyel.com/projects/10/medusa)? Should you choose the most basic option or one that can develop along with your company?

We will contrast the top eCommerce platforms, Medusa and [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=acquisition_search_brand_row&utm_content=woocommerce&gclid=CjwKCAjw_ISWBhBkEiwAdqxb9tpNKcyrGKvUepxgm4ygmxy6zNS6v2Y25WhQ6yLv-PQUUpRp4Wht1xoCSpEQAvD_BwE) in this article. To assist you in determining which eCommerce platform is best for your company, we will also discuss it in detail about them.

# Why do we require eCommerce Platforms?

Ecommerce platforms, which enable the front end and back end to operate collaboratively and effectively, are the fundamental building blocks of every online retail business. A B2B or B2C eCommerce firm is backed by eCommerce platforms, which act as the girders of the eCommerce edifice.

They give your firm an accessible means to distribute and sell things online to a large pool of prospective clients. Another advantage of adopting a strong eCommerce platform is streamlining business interactions with clients, consumers, and staff.

**Guidelines and advice for implementing eCommerce platforms:**

1. Begin with a vision that articulates the strategic direction of your eCommerce plan. This should be developed with input from your consumers and with their participation.
    
2. Create a structure to help you realize your goal. Before you start implementing what consumers see, identify your data and create your interfaces.
    
3. Choose an implementation partner who is most likely to be able to take the vision and fully realize it. It is crucial to pick a partner who has previous expertise with deployments on your scale and in your market.
    
4. Choose a platform that best suits your vision and business procedures. Not only other e-commerce sites but compare it with these as well.
    

Let's have a look at the two most notable ones!

# WooCommerce

WooCommerce is a WordPress eCommerce plugin. With fair levels of customization and numerous essential features like inventory and tax administration, secure payments, and shipping integration, it makes setting up and running an online business streamlined.

You may use it to convert a WordPress website into an online store.  Having items, a shopping cart, and checkout choices is possible with a WordPress e-commerce site.

# Why is Medusa better?

Developers may design incredible digital commerce experiences with the help of this open-source headless commerce engine, [Medusa](https://medusajs.com/).

In a broader sense, Medusa focuses on letting developers accomplish much more with less; this aligns with ensuring that merchants can take control of their commerce setup by allowing developers to influence the direction and roadmap for the project without relying on Medusa to generate the functionality the developer needs. [Medusa](https://discord.com/invite/medusajs) helps developers become more productive and laser-focused by building them strong tools.

## Features

To support your projects, [Medusa](https://survivejs.com/blog/medusa-interview/) offers preconfigured and optimized infrastructure.

1. WooCommerce has a fairly limited feature set.
    
2. To compete with other eCommerce functionalities, WooCommerce needs a lot of plugins and many WordPress plugins may cause a slew of conflicts, slowdowns, and excessive maintenance expenses.
    
3. WooCommerce's simple database architecture makes it poorly suited for use with huge catalogs and order volumes.
    
4. WooCommerce is less user-friendly and does not scale as Medusa does.
    
5. Every part of [Medusa](https://medusajs.com/blog/which-frontend-framework-you-should-pick-for-your-ecommerce-storefront/), including the core, permits customization. Therefore, Medusa can be your choice. Because of Medusa's flexibility in implementing the subscription model, one of WooCommerce's clients is already in the process of migrating to Medusa. Check out their story [here](https://medusajs.com/blog/case-study-tekla-medusa/).
    
6. WooCommerce's ease of use in comparison to other platforms will be one thing, but Medusa has entirely flipped the norms.
    
7. Additionally, Medusa is far easier to use than any other eCommerce platform, defeating the primary claim of WooCommerce.
    

# Closing

You now have all the information you need to select the platform that is most suitable for you because we have outlined all the major distinctions.  Although both systems are top-notch, [Medusa](https://docs.medusajs.com/) prevails thanks to its integrated sales capabilities, improved usability, and short production times.

But it doesn't necessarily follow that it will be the best option for everyone just because it is my favorite. So, I suggest you give [Medusa](https://aviyel.com/projects/10/medusa) a shot and see how it works out for you. I’m sure you will love the experience of working with it.
